# CSC311-Recommender-System-Project
This is the final project of the course CSC311: Introduction to Machine Learning at the University of Toronto. \
The goal is to build machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student can correctly answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student’s previous answers to other questions and other students’ responses. The model uses answers of 542 students to 1774 diagnostic questions from the dataset provided by Eedi (https://eedi.com/) with also additional meta data. \
The algorithms that were used were: k-Nearest Neighbor, Matrix Factorization, and Ensemble of KNN models.
